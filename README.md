Another led blinking sketch

   LED chaser for taillight bike, e-bike, scooter...

   This program creates a running light which is more visible than a steady ON light.
   A stock taillight had a PIC controller that started on the push of a button on the back of the taillight.
   Since mine is switched from the handlebar this was not an option for my use.
   It contained five different patterns, all leds steady on, all leds flashing, leds chasing
   from left to right, leds chasing from right to left and a sort of chasing, left and right half simulaneously,
   in "optical" circles.
   I needed only one pattern, so I re-created the last pattern
